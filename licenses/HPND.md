notes: |
  This license has been voluntarily deprecated by its author. Original license submission in 2002 was intended to
  provide a template distilled from permission notices used in many packages. As per the original notes, "It may
  be possible to construct a grammatically incorrect license from this template, or one that lacks a disclaimer, or
  one that includes a double-disclaimer. That is acceptable, as long as it remains impossible to construct a
  non-OSD-compliant license that matches the pattern."
