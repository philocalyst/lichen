"Affiliates" of a party shall mean an entity

a) which is directly or indirectly controlling such party;

b) which is under the same direct or indirect ownership or control as such party; or

c) which is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party.

For these purposes, an entity shall be treated as being controlled by another if that other entity has fifty percent (50%) or more of the votes in such entity, is able to direct its affairs and/or to control the composition of its board of directors or equivalent body.

"Commercial Use" shall mean distribution or otherwise making the Covered Software available to a third party.

"Contributor" shall mean each entity that creates or contributes to the creation of Modifications.

"Contributor Version" shall mean in case of any Contributor the combination of the Original Software, prior Modifications used by a Contributor, and the Modifications made by that particular Contributor and in case of Nokia in addition the Original Software in any form, including the form as Exceutable.

"Covered Software" shall mean the Original Software or Modifications or the combination of the Original Software and Modifications, in each case including portions thereof.

"Electronic Distribution Mechanism" shall mean a mechanism generally accepted in the software development community for the electronic transfer of data.

"Executable" shall mean Covered Software in any form other than Source Code.

"Nokia" shall mean Nokia Corporation and its Affiliates.

"Larger Work" shall mean a work, which combines Covered Software or portions thereof with code not governed by the terms of this License.

"Modifications" shall mean any addition to or deletion from the substance or structure of either the Original Software or any previous Modifications. When Covered Software is released as a series of files, a Modification is:

a) Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file containing Original Software or previous Modifications.

b) Any new file that contains any part of the Original Software or previous Modifications.

"Original Software" shall mean the Source Code of computer software code which is described in the Source Code notice required by Exhibit A as Original Software, and which, at the time of its release under this License is not already Covered Software governed by this License.

"Patent Claims" shall mean any patent claim(s), now owned or hereafter acquired, including without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims, in any patent Licensable by grantor.

"Source Code" shall mean the preferred form of the Covered Software for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control compilation and installation of an Executable, or source code differential comparisons against either the Original Software or another well known, available Covered Software of the Contributor's choice. The Source Code can be in a compressed or archival form, provided the appropriate decompression or de-archiving software is widely available for no charge.

"You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a future version of this License issued under Section 6.1. For legal entities, "You" includes Affiliates of such entity.

  b) and under Patents Claims necessarily infringed by the making, using or selling of Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or portions thereof).

  c) The licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on the date Nokia first distributes Original Software under the terms of this License.

2.2 Contributor Grant.

3.1 Application of License.

3.2 Availability of Source Code.

3.3 Description of Modifications.

3.4 Intellectual Property Matters
  (a) Third Party Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

  (b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL file.

  (c) Representations. Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.

8.

8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Software which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

8.2 If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Nokia or a Contributor (Nokia or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that:
  a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against such Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period specified above.

  b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that Participant.

8.3 If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.

8.4 In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

This License is governed by the laws of Finland excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
