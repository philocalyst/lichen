notes: |
  NetBSD adopted this 2-clause license in 2008 for code contributed to NetBSD Foundation.
  It is being deprecated as a separate license because it is a match to BSD-2-Clause.
  The line describing that the code is derived from software contributed to NetBSD
  is not viewed as being a substantive part of the license text.
