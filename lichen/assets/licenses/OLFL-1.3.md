  the Subject Matter of the License.

  However, said patent license shall cover only those rights deriving from the patents of the respective Contributors which are indispensable in order not to infringe that patent and only to the extent that the use of the Contributor's respective Contributions, whether alone or in combination with other Contributions of the Contributors or any third parties together with the Subject Matter of the License for which these Contributions were submitted, would otherwise infringe that patent. The grant of license shall not include rights deriving from the patents which may in future become necessary for their lawful use due to subsequent modifications to the Subject Matter or Contributions made by third parties after the original submission.

   In the event that You institute patent litigation against any entity or person (including a counterclaim or countersuit in a legal action), alleging that the Subject Matter of the License or a Contribution incorporated or contained therein constitutes patent infringement or indirect infringement, all patent licenses which have been granted to You under this License for the Subject Matter of the License as well as this License itself shall be deemed terminated as of the date on which the action is filed.
* {{#if placeholder32}}{{placeholder32}}{{else}}ยง4{{/if}} Distribution

  You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Subject Matter of the License or Derivative Works on any medium, with or without modifications (with regard to software components in Source or Object form), provided that You comply with the following rules:

  * {{#if placeholder33}}{{placeholder33}}{{else}}-{{/if}} You must provide all other recipients of the Subject Matter of the License or of Derivative Works with a copy of this License and inform them that the Subject Matter of the License was originally licensed under this License.
  * {{#if placeholder34}}{{placeholder34}}{{else}}-{{/if}} You must ensure that modified files contain prominent notices indicating that You have modified the files.
  * {{#if placeholder35}}{{placeholder35}}{{else}}-{{/if}} You must retain all copyright, patent, trademark and attribution notices in the Subject Matter of the License in the Source form of any Derivative Works You distribute, with the exception of those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works.

  You may add Your own copyright notices to Your modifications and state any additional or different license conditions and conditions for the use, reproduction or distribution of Your modifications or for those Derivative Works as a whole, provided that Your use, reproduction and distribution of the work complies with the terms and conditions set out in this License in all other respects.

* {{#if placeholder36}}{{placeholder36}}{{else}}ยง5{{/if}} Submission of Contributions

  Unless expressly stated otherwise, every Contribution that You have intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Subject Matter of the License is subject to this License without any additional terms or conditions applying. Irrespective of the above, none of the terms or conditions contained herein may be interpreted to supersede or modify the terms or conditions of any separate licensing agreement that You may have concluded with a Licensor for such Contributions, such as a so-called &quot;Contributor License Agreement&quot; (CLA).

* {{#if placeholder37}}{{placeholder37}}{{else}}ยง6{{/if}} Trademarks

  This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks or product names of the Licensor(s) or of a Contributor.

* {{#if placeholder38}}{{placeholder38}}{{else}}ยง7{{/if}} Limited warranty

  This License is granted free of charge and thus constitutes a gift. Accordingly, any warranty is excluded. The Subject Matter of the License is a work in progress; it is constantly being improved by countless Contributors. The Subject Matter of the License is not complete and may therefore contain errors (&quot;bugs&quot;) or additional patents of Contributors or third parties, as is inherent in this type of development.

* {{#if placeholder39}}{{placeholder39}}{{else}}ยง8{{/if}} Limitation of liability

  Except in cases of intentional and grossly negligent conduct, the Contributors, their legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for direct or indirect, material or immaterial loss or damage of any kind arising from the License or the use of the Subject Matter of the License; this applies, among other things, but not exclusively, to loss of goodwill, loss of production, computer failures or errors, loss of data or economic loss or damage, even if the Contributor has been notified of the possibility of such loss or damage. Irrespective of the above, the Licensor shall only be liable within the scope of statutory product liability to the extent that the respective provisions are applicable to the Subject Matter of the License or the Contribution.

  Except in cases of intentional conduct, the Contributors, their legal representatives, trustees, officers and employees shall not be liable for any infringement of third-party patent or intellectual property rights arising from the Contributions nor do they warrant that the Contributions are accurate, devoid of mistakes, complete and/or fit for any particular purpose.

* {{#if placeholder40}}{{placeholder40}}{{else}}ยง9{{/if}} Provision of warranties or assumption of additional liability in the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License

  In the event of distribution of the Subject Matter of the License or Derivative Works, You are free to accept support, warranty, indemnity or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License and to charge a fee in return. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

* {{#if placeholder41}}{{placeholder41}}{{else}}ยง10{{/if}} Applicable law

  This License is governed by German law, excluding its conflict of laws provisions and the provisions of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
