* {{#if placeholder0}}{{placeholder0}}{{else}}Preamble{{/if}} The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users the right to modify and re-use the software governed by this license.

  The exercising of this right is conditional upon the obligation to make available to the community the modifications made to the source code of the software so as to contribute to its evolution.

  In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.

  In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom.

  This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
