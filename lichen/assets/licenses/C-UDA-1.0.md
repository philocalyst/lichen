  * {{#if placeholder16}}{{placeholder16}}{{else}}5.1.{{/if}} &quot;Computational Use&quot; means activities necessary to enable the use of Data (alone or along with other material) for analysis by a computer.
  * {{#if placeholder17}}{{placeholder17}}{{else}}5.2.{{/if}} &quot;Data&quot; means the material you receive under the C-UDA in modified or unmodified form, but not including Results.
  * {{#if placeholder18}}{{placeholder18}}{{else}}5.3.{{/if}} &quot;Data Provider&quot; means the source from which you receive the Data and with whom you enter into the C-UDA.
