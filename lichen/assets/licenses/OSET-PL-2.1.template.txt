         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}c.{{/if}} under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
      This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).

      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}2.4{{/if}} Subsequent Licenses
      No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}2.5{{/if}} Representation
      Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}2.6{{/if}} Fair Use
      This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}2.7{{/if}} Conditions
      Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.{{/if}} Responsibilities
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.1{{/if}} Distribution of Source Form
      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You must cause any of Your Modifications to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.2{{/if}} Distribution of Executable Form
      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}a.{{/if}} such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}b.{{/if}} You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.3{{/if}} Distribution of a Larger Work
      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.4{{/if}} Notices
      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.5{{/if}} Application of Additional Terms
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.5.1{{/if}} You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}3.5.2{{/if}} You may place additional conditions upon the rights granted in this License to the extent necessary due to statute, judicial order, regulation (including without limitation state and federal procurement regulation), national security, or public interest. Any such additional conditions must be clearly described in the notice provisions required under Section 3.4. Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies of the Covered Software distributed by You or by any downstream recipients that receive the Covered Software from You.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}4.{{/if}} Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be included in the notices required under Section 3.4. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.{{/if}} Termination
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.1{{/if}} Failure to Comply
      The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60-days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30-days after Your receipt of the notice.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.2{{/if}} Patent Infringement Claims
      If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and {{#if crossClaimsSpace}}{{crossClaimsSpace}}{{else}}cross-claims{{/if}} ) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.3{{/if}} Additional Compliance Terms
      Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 5, for purposes of this Section, if You breach Section 3.1 (Distribution of Source Form), Section 3.2 (Distribution of Executable Form), Section 3.3 (Distribution of a Larger Work), or Section 3.4 (Notices), then becoming compliant as described in Section 5.1 must also include, no later than 30 days after receipt by You of notice of such violation by a Contributor, making the Covered Software available in Source Code Form as required by this License on a publicly available computer network for a period of no less than three (3) years.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.4{{/if}} Contributor Remedies
      If You fail to comply with the terms of this License and do not thereafter become compliant in accordance with Section 5.1 and, if applicable, Section 5.3, then each Contributor reserves its right, in addition to any other rights it may have in law or in equity, to bring an action seeking injunctive relief, or damages for willful copyright or patent infringement (including without limitation damages for unjust enrichment, where available under law), for all actions in violation of rights that would otherwise have been granted under the terms of this License.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}5.5{{/if}} End User License Agreements
      In the event of termination under this Section 5, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers), which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}6.{{/if}} Disclaimer of Warranty
   Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}7.{{/if}} Limitation of Liability
   Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}8.{{/if}} Litigation
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.{{/if}} Government Terms
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.1{{/if}} Commercial Item
      The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.3.1{{/if}} If You are a government of a state of the United States, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such a state government, this License shall be governed by the law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in such state.
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.3.2{{/if}} If You are an agency of the United States federal government, or Your use of the Covered Software is pursuant to a procurement contract with such an agency, this License shall be governed by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, D.C.
         {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.3.3{{/if}} You may alter the terms of this Section 9.3 for this License as described in Section 3.5.2.
      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}9.4{{/if}} Supremacy
      This Section 9 is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other Federal Acquisition Regulation, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation, or other clause or provision that addresses government rights in computer software under this License.
   {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}10.{{/if}} Miscellaneous
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation, which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter, shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

      {{#if bullet}}{{bullet}}{{else}}11.1{{/if}} New Versions
      The Open Source Election Technology Foundation ("OSET") (formerly known as the Open Source Digital Voting Foundation) is the steward of this License.
